# A fully featured asset pipeline based on gulp.

Gulp Starter applies community best practices and allows you to quick start your next project /
explore a new library's API without worrying too much about automatization tasks.

It is **project structure agnostic**. You can use any folder structure you like (the current one, component based etc).

You dont have to wait seconds until the re-compilation process is done, all tasks has 
**incremental build optimalization**.

It is **backend agnostic**, you can use the opt-in sample api or any existing backend api.

This project is inspired by [vigetlabs/gulp-starter](https://github.com/vigetlabs/gulp-starter).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vigetlabs/gulp-starter.git MyApp
cd MyApp && npm i
```

# Basic Usage
Make sure at least Node ^4.0.0 is installed. I recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage versions.

#### Install Dependencies
```
npm i
```

#### Start compiling, serving, and watching files
```
npm run dev
```

(or `gulp --dev`)

This runs `gulp` from `./node_modules/bin`, using the version installed with this project, rather than a globally installed instance. All commands in the package.json `scripts` work this way. The `gulp` command runs the `default` task, defined in `asset-pipeline/tasks/default.js`.

All files will compile in development mode (uncompressed with source maps). [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/) will serve up files to `localhost:3000` and will stream live changes to the code and assets to all connected browsers.

#### Configuration
Directory and top level settings are conveniently exposed in `asset-pipeline/config.js`. All task configuration objects have `src` and `dest` directories specified.

### Build production-ready files
```
npm run prod
```

This will compile revision and compressed files to `./dist/prod`. To build production files and preview them localy, run

```
npm run demo
```

(or `gulp --prod`)

If you want to check your production build run `npm run demo` http://localhost:8080. This is primarily meant as a way to preview your production build locally.

# FAQ

#### How to replace the sample API with an existing backend API?
Go to `asset-pipeline/tasks/browser-sync.js` comment out option A, and the `middleware` part.

```js
// A, if you don't have a backend api use the built in server
// server: {
//   baseDir: DEST_DIR
// },

// B, if you got a backend api proxy the request to it
proxy: 'example.com',

// custom middleware for mock api
// middleware(req, res, next) {
//   require(join(ROOT_DIR, 'api', 'api'))(req, res, next);
// },
```

#### Why Browserify?
[Why not?](https://gist.github.com/substack/68f8d502be42d5cd4942) I have abosuletly no problem with browserify.
